# Logify

> Logify is still in the early stages of development, no installation method has been set out yet. If you are looking to contribute to Logify, please contact the [moderator](mailto:gbrad012@uottawa.ca). 

Logify takes input from multiple consoles and condenses the data into one easy to use table. This tool is designed for anyone who needs to keep tabs on console output. Logfiy is an app that is installed via the command line, and it runs locally on the user's machine. The user simply redirects the console output to Logfiy, and the rest is taken care of.

### Use Cases
- Scientists running experiments via MATLAB or Python
    - This tool can easily direct all the output from the experiment to go into the Logify app. Logify is extremely robust and can run for days or weeks on end.
